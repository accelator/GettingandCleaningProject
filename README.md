GettingandCleaningProject
=========================
The run_analysis.R script is my code for getting and cleaning data project. In order to process this code, you should set
the main directory in your local computer. Then, you should download the zip file which contain the necessary data on and 
decompress the zip file to your main directory. Now, it's fine for you to process the script. In that script, I clearly note
which part of script is responsible for certain question. You can deal with it step by step. However, there is one thing 
that you should attention, when you are processing the script step by step, you cannot clear workspace.
